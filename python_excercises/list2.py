# Additional basic list exercises

# D. Given a list of numbers, return a list where
# all adjacent == elements have been reduced to a single element,
# so [1, 2, 2, 3] returns [1, 2, 3]. You may create a new list or
# modify the passed in list.
def remove_adjacent(nums):
  # +++your code here+++

  #HINT: there is such collection like set - set has the feature which You need there - it contains non-repetetive elements.
  #  Please consider this:)
  # Another one method - which is more obvious - is creating another one list in function body and iterate on input list,
  #  and then checking if our new list contains iterator (currently pointed element) or not. Similar to previous one excercises :)

  return


# E. Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create and return a merged
# list of all the elements in sorted order. You may modify the passed in lists.
# Ideally, the solution should work in "linear" time, making a single
# pass of both lists.
def linear_merge(list1, list2):
  # +++your code here+++
  # HINT: iterate on the longer collection (list in this case) and compare elements from both lists.
  # Manipulate indexes (in similar way like below). Try to invent another one solution (different from this below)

# Note: the solution above is kind of cute, but unforunately list.pop(0)

# from each list, building a solution list which is backwards.
# Then use reversed() to put the result back in the correct order. That
# solution works in linear time, but is more ugly.
